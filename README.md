Bumbuu
--------------------------------

[Bumbuu](http://bumbuu.com) is a social network currently in development.

##Paradigm
The model of Bumbuu is ideally one that distances itself from the "commercialism" and narcissism of Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and (what was once popular) MySpace. By establishing itself as a social network oriented entirely around truly *social* interaction, and not one where "Likes", shared stories, and one-sided corporate or financial spheres can gain prominence as the metric by which "socializing" is considered, Bumbuu aims to do something different. It is arguable that this model, currently in effect at Facebook, mimics the same philosophy that "killed" MySpace: too much focus on advertisements with the network's purpose as a "cash cow" for future businesses, and an emphasis on narcissistic interaction, which both detract from the idealism of a simple electronic version of face-to-face interaction.


It should not be possible to be antisocial on a "social" network.
 

Consequently, a basic principle of Bumbuu will be that it contains no advertisements. (Yes, I don't intend to make this a profit; donations would be acceptable, however). People wishing to promote their product or service can go to LinkedIn. People wishing to garner tokens of approval ("Likes") can go to Facebook. People wishing to espouse their views for everyone to see but no one to comment on or discuss can go to the micro-blogging sites of Twitter and Tumblr. Those wishing to participate in an equal discussion, where the merits of what you say and how you actually *contribute* to those around you can take part in a social network that respects such a purpose.


I'm trying to do something different here, and while I can't be sure of its feasibility, at least someone can say that there was an effort to change things.
