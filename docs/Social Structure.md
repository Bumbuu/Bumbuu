Social Structure of Bumbuu
==========================

##Friend-like Interaction
As Bumbuu is aiming to do something different from the approach to "socializing" from the various other social networks, the end goal shall be a social structure that is more thoroughly engaging between two or more people. There are some proposals to accomplish this:

* An automatic friends list:
 - Those who you most commonly socialize with on Bumbuu, according to an arbitrary minimum number of conversations and interactions, will be displayed in a list of your friends.
 - **Some drawbacks** with this method involve the need of an algorithm to distinguish between friendly interaction and unfriendly interaction, as to avoid any improper mentionings on the list.
 - A solution to this drawback could be to enable the user to only remove friends from their list.
